# 2D Steam multiplayer demo in Godot

This is a demo of how I implemented a simple Steam integrated 2D multiplayer system in Godot 4.4.1. The demo is intended as a minimal example for how to setup basic multiplayer with Steam

Note:
- This demo is built on the pre-compiled version of GodotSteam MultiplayerPeer (https://codeberg.org/godotsteam/multiplayerpeer)
- Heavily inspired by this 3D demo I found (https://github.com/kirbycope/godotsteam-multiplayerpeer-example-3d/tree/main)

Includes:
- loading lobby screen
- transitions to gameplay when all players are ready
- camera follow individual players
- server host is included in gameplay
